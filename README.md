### Hej 👋

I'm José Areia, a graduate student pursuing an MSc in Cybersecurity & Digital Forensics at the Polytechnic of Leiria. Alongside my studies, I serve as an Invited Assistant Professor and Graduate Student Researcher at the same institution.

My current focus is on the research project "Secure and Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning" at the Computer Science and Communication Research Centre of the Polytechnic of Leiria. Additionally, I teach Network and Computer Systems Security within the Short Cycle Program of Cybersecurity and Computer Networks.

Please explore the [Achinkad Organisation](https://github.com/Achinkad/) to discover the projects I've developed during both my BSc and MSc courses.
