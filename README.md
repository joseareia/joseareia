### Halló þarna

I’m José Areia, an MSc student in Cybersecurity & Digital Forensics at the [Polytechnic of Leiria](https://www.ipleiria.pt/politecnico/institucional/politecnico/), where I also work as an Invited Assistant Professor and Fellow Researcher.

My research focuses on **Secure and Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning** at the Computer Science and Communication Research Centre. I also teach Network and Computer Systems Security in the Short Cycle Program of Cybersecurity and Computer Networks.

Please explore the [Achinkad Organisation](https://github.com/Achinkad/) to discover the projects I've developed during both my BSc and MSc courses.
